`RatInABox` (paper [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.10.503541v1)) is a toolkit for generating locomotion trajectories and complementary neural data for spatially and/or velocity selective cell types. With `RatInABox` you can: 

* **Generate realistic trajectories** for rats exploring complex 1- and 2-dimensional environments under a smooth random policy, an external control signal, or your own trajectory data.
* **Generate artificial neuronal data** Simulate various location or velocity selective cells found in the Hippocampal-Entorhinal system, or build your own more complex cell type. 
* **Build and train complex networks** Build, train and analyse complex networks of cells, powered by data generated with `RatInABox`.
