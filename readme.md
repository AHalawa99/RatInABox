# RatInABox üêÄüì¶

![](./readme_figs/whole_simulation.gif)

RatInABox is a toolkit for simulating navigation and/or hippocampal-entorhinal cell types. With it you can:

* Generate pseudo-realistic trajectories for rats foraging/exploring 1 and 2D environments
* Simulate spatially selective cells typically found in the Hippocampal-Entorhinal system (place cells, grid cells, boundary vector cells, and velocity cells). 

This is not gridworld. RatInABox represents a clean departure from pre-discretised "gridworld" models which have typically been used for simulating hippocampal navigation. Position and neuronal firing rates are calculated online with float precision. 

`RatInABox` contains three classes: 

1. `Environment()`: The environment/maze that the agent lives in. 1- or 2-dimensional. Handles geometry, walls, boundary conditions etc.
2. `Agent()`: The agent (or "rat") moving around the Environment. 
3. `Neurons()`: A population of neurons. Neurons have firing rates determined by the state of the Agent (e.g. its position). 

The above animation shows the kind of simulation you can easily run using this toolbox. It shows an agent randomly exploring a 2D environment with a wall. Four populations of cells (place cells, grid cells, boundary vector cells and velocity cells) "fire" as the agent explores. Below shows the code needed to replicate this exact simulation (13 lines).

```
Env = Environment()
Ag = Agent(params={'Environment':Env})
PlaceCells = Neurons(params={'Agent':Ag,
                             'cell_class':'place_cells'})
GridCells = Neurons(params={'Agent':Ag,
                            'cell_class':'grid_cells'})
BoundaryVectorCells = Neurons(params={'Agent':Ag,
                                      'cell_class':'boundary_vector_cells'})
VelocityCells = Neurons(params={'Agent':Ag,
                                'cell_class':'velocity_cells'})

Env.add_wall(np.array([[0.3,0.0],[0.3,0.4]])) #add wall to Environment

while Ag.t < 60: #explore for 60 seconds
    Ag.update()
    PlaceCells.update()
    GridCells.update()
    BoundaryVectorCells.update()
    VelocityCells.update()
```

## Key features

* Flexible: Generate arbitrarily complex environments 
* Realistic: Simulate large realistic populations of neuronal cell types known to be found in the brain. 
* Fast: Simulating 1 hour of exploration in a 2D environment with 100 place cells (dt=10 ms) take 20 secs. 1 minutes exploration takes 3 seconds. Cells are rate based or Poisson spiking. 
* Precise: No more pre-discretised positions, tabular state spaces, or jerky movement policies. It's all continuous here. 
* Plotting: Easy plot animate trajectories, firing rate timeseries', spike rasters, receptive fields, heat maps and more using our plotting functions. 
* Easy: sensible default parameters mean you can have realisitic simulation data to work with in <20 lines of code. 

Currently supported cell types are:

## Feature run-down
Here is a list of features loosely organised into three categories: those pertaining to (i) the Environment, (ii) the Agent and (iii) the Neurons. 

### (i) `Environment()` features
#### Walls 
Arbitrarily add walls to the environment to replicate any desired maze structure. The following code shows how to add walls to make a multicompartment environment like used in Carpenter et al. (2015). 
```
Env.add_wall([[0.3,0.0],[0.3,0.5]])
```
![](./readme_figs/walls.png)

#### Boundary conditions 
Boundary conditions can be "periodic" or "solid". Place cells and the Agent will respect boundaries accordingly. Initialise with 'solid' or 'periodic' boundary conditions with 
```
Env = Environment(
    params = {'boundary_conditions':'periodic'} #or 'solid' (default)
) 
```
![](./readme_figs/boundary_conditions.png)

#### 1- or 2-dimensions 
Most features work in both 1 and 2 dimensions. The following figure shows 1 min of exploration of an agent in a 1D environment with periodic boundary conditions spanned by 10 place cells. 
Initialise a 1- or 2D environmnet like 
```
Env = Environment(
    params = {'dimensionality':'1D'} #or '2D' (default)
) 
```
![](./readme_figs/one_dimension.png)


### (ii) `Agent()` features
#### Wall repelling 
Walls in the environment mildly "repel" the agent. Coupled with the finite turning speed this creates, somewhat counterintuitively, a combined effect where the agent is biased to  over-explore near walls and corners. This is displayed in the heatmaps below which summarise 1 hour of exploration with wall repulsion on (left) and off(right). Note increased time spent near walls in left, but not right plot. This bias is true of real rodent foraging behaviour. 
```
Œëg.walls_repel = True #False
```
![](./readme_figs/walls_repel.png)

#### Random motion model
Motion is modelled stochastically. In 2D speed and rotational speed take constrained random walks governed by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. You can change the variance and coherence times of these processes to control the shape of the trajectory.
```
Agent.speed_mean = 0.2
Agent.speed_std = 0.1
Agent.speed_coherence_time = 3
Agent.rotation_velocity_std = 0.1
Agent.rotational_velocity_coherence_time = 3
```
The following set of trajectories were generated by modifying the rotational_velocity_std
![](./readme_figs/motion_model.png)


#### Policy control 
By default the movement policy is an uncontrolled "smooth" random walk (displayed above) where the velocity is governed by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. It is possible, however, to manually pass a "drift velocity" to the Agent, towards which its velocity will drift. We envisage this being use, for example, by an Actor-Critic system to control the Agent. The actor-critic system could take as inout (conveniently) the firing rate of some Neurons(). As a demonstartion that such a drift velocity could be used to control the agents movement here we set a radial drift velocity to encourage circular motion.   
```
Agent.update(drift_velocity=drift_velocity)
```
![](./readme_figs/policy_control.png)


### (iii) `Neuron()` features 

#### Multiple cell types: 
Currently supported cell types (`params['cell_class']`)  are: 
* "place_cells"
* "grid_cells"": rectified sum of three cosine plane waves
* "boundary_vector_cells": double exponential model matching de Cothi and Barry (2020)
* "velocity_cells": cells encode positive and negative x and y velocitys (2N cells in N-dimensions)

Place cells come in multiple types (give by `params['description']`). For each type the relevant width parameter is given by `params['widths']`. 
* "gaussian": normal gaussian place cell 
* "gaussian_threshold": gaussian thresholded at 1 sigma
* "diff_of_gaussian": gaussian(sigma) - gaussian(1.5 sigma)
* "top_hat": circular receptive field, max firing rate within, min firing rate otherwise
* "one_hot": the closest palce cell to any given location is established. This and only this cell fires. 

This last place cell type one_hot is useful as it essentially rediscretises space and tabularises the state space. Can be used to effortlessly contrast and compare learning algorithms acting over continuous vs discrete state spaces. 

#### Geometry
Choose how you want place cells to interact with walls in the environment. We provide three types of geometries. 
![](./readme_figs/wall_geometry.png)

#### Spiking 
All neurons are rate based. Additionally we generate spikes as though they were Poisson neuros. These are stored in `Neurons.history['spikes']`. The max and min firing rates can be set with `Neurons.max_fr` and  `Neurons.min_fr`. We recommend setting dt such that `Neurons.max_fr * Agent.dt <<< 1`.
```
Neurons.plot_rate_timeseries(spikes=True)
Neurons.plot_ratemap(spikes=True)
```
![](./readme_figs/spikes.png)


#### Rate maps 
Place cells, grid cells and boundary vector cells have analytic receptive fields. These can be displayed by querying their firing rate at an array of positions spanning the environment then plotting this. 

An alternative, and ultimately more robust way to display the receptive field is to plot a heatmap of the positions of the Agent has visited weighted by the firing rate observed at each position. Over time, as coverage become complete, the firing fields become visible.  Velocity neurons provide a good example; they have no predefined/analytic "receptive field" but the firing-rate-weighted position heatmap is still well defined and can be plotted. 
```
Neurons.plot_rate_map() #attempted to plot analytic rate map 
Neurons.plot_rate_map(by_history=True) #plots rate map by firing-rate-weighted position heatmap
``` 
![](./readme_figs/rate_map.png)

#### More complex Neuron types
We encourage more comlex Neuron classes to be made with the Neuron() class as parent. Specifically by writing your own `update()` and `get_state()` you can create more complex networks of neurons which, e.g. take weighted inouts of other neuronal layers, are recurrent, etc. By saving firingrate at each step plotting functions shown here should still be fucntional.
